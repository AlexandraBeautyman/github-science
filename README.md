I am using this repository to help me figure out more about how Github works!

So far, I have learned that if you delete a repository on Github, the commits you made to that repository in the past no longer count towards your total commits. For example, they disappear from your visualization that tracks your commits per day. I think the idea is that all traces of the repos existence are destroyed.

I've also learned that you can re-push from your local copy up to a newly created replacement of that repo, so you can recover lost work if you have an up-to-date local copy.
